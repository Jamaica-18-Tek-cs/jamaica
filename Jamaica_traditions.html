        Jamaican revivalism is a mix between European and African religious traditions.
        That has turned into something so uniquely Jamaican. The Revivalism is based on Christianity with a twist of African,
        meaning the attitude to nature and spirituality are coming for mixed African religions, as is the style of worship. 
        It began between 1860 and 1861 and involves singing, drumming, dancing and much more. 
        Revivalism is done to revitalize the spirutual ardour of their members and to attract new followers.

    <li><p>Jamaicans practice traditional funeral ceremonies which are distinctive to their culture,
         an example is that when a person dies Jamaicans gather at the home of the deceased person for eight nights after their passing, 
         during these nights their friends and family will celebrate the life of the deceased person,
         on the last night they sing farewell songs as well as rearranging the furnishings so that their spirit won't stay afterwards and move on.
