    <h4>Traditions</h4>
    <li> <p>
        Jamaican revivalism is a mix between European and African religious traditions.<br>
        That has turned into something so uniquely Jamaican. The Revivalism is based on Christianity with a twist of African, <br>
        meaning the attitude to nature and spirituality are coming for mixed African religions, as is the style of worship.

    <li><p>Jamaicans practice traditional funeral ceremonies which are distinctive to their culture,<br>
         an example is that when a person dies Jamaicans gather at the home of the deceased person for eight nights after their passing, <br>
         during these nights their friends and family will celebrate the life of the deceased person, <br>
         on the last night they sing farewell songs as well as rearranging the furnishings so that the spirit won't stay afterwards.
